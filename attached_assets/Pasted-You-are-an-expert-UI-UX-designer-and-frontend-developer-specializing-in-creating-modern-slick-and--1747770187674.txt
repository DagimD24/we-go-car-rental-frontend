You are an expert UI/UX designer and frontend developer specializing in creating modern, slick, and visually appealing web applications using Tailwind CSS. Your task is to generate the HTML structure with appropriate Tailwind CSS classes for several key pages of a Car Rental System web application.
Overall Design Ethos & Aesthetics:
Modern & Slick: Think clean lines, ample whitespace, high-quality imagery, intuitive navigation, and a professional feel.
User-Friendly: Interfaces should be intuitive, with clear calls to action and easy-to-understand layouts.
Premium Feel: The design should evoke a sense of quality and trust, appropriate for a car rental service.
Color Palette (Suggestion): Propose and use a modern and sophisticated color palette. Consider a primary accent color (e.g., a vibrant blue, deep teal, or energetic orange), a range of grays for text and backgrounds, and potentially a secondary accent color. Ensure good contrast for accessibility.
Typography: Suggest and use a clean, legible sans-serif font pairing (e.g., Inter, Poppins, Montserrat). Ensure clear typographic hierarchy.
Iconography: Use modern, minimalist icons (e.g., Heroicons or similar style) where appropriate.
Imagery: Assume high-quality, professional car photos and lifestyle imagery. Use appropriate placeholder dimensions.
Responsiveness: All generated UI must be fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
Subtle Interactions (Optional but Desired): Where appropriate, style elements to suggest interactivity (e.g., hover states for buttons and links, subtle shadows on cards).
Dark Mode (Consideration): While not the primary request, if the chosen color palette easily adapts or if you can provide dark mode variants (e.g., dark:bg-gray-800), that would be a bonus.

Navbar:
Logo placeholder on the left.

Car Grid:
Responsive grid (e.g., 1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3-4 on desktop).

Booking Call-to-Action:
Prominent "Book Now" button that would (conceptually) lead to the booking form/page or prompt login.

G. Terms & Conditions Modal/Page
Modal Styling: Clean, centered modal with good readability.
Content Area: Well-formatted text using react-markdown styling (headings, lists, paragraphs should be clear).
"Close" or "Accept" buttons.
Output Requirements:
Provide the HTML structure with Tailwind CSS classes directly inline.
For each page/section, please provide a self-contained block of HTML.
Use placeholder images (e.g., https://via.placeholder.com/800x600 or similar, adjust dimensions as needed).
Use placeholder text (Lorem Ipsum) for longer content.
Focus on achieving the described modern and slick aesthetic.
If you make strong design choices (e.g., a specific color palette), please briefly state them.
Let's start with the Navbar and Footer (Global Components), and then the Car Listing Page (/cars). I will ask for other pages subsequently."
How to use this prompt:
Break it down: Don't give Gemini the entire prompt at once. It might produce too much code or lose context. Start with "Global Components" and one key page (like "Car Listing").
Iterate: Review the output. If it's not quite right, give feedback: "This is good, but can we make the car cards have a slightly larger shadow on hover?" or "Could you try a different primary accent color, maybe a deep teal, for the buttons on the Car Listing page?"
Be Specific: The more specific your feedback, the better Gemini can refine its output.
Focus on Visuals: This prompt is geared towards the look and feel. You'll wire up the functionality (Next.js, Appwrite, React Query) later.
This prompt sets a high bar for design quality and provides enough detail for Gemini to generate some impressive Tailwind CSS structures. Good luck!
